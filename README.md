# 🕒 React Clock, Stopwatch & To-Do List

A simple React application that combines a real-time clock, a stopwatch, and a to-do list — all on a single page. Built using React with functional components and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), and powered by **Vite** for fast development and build performance.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Clock** – Displays the current time in real-time (HH:MM:SS).
- **Stopwatch** – Start, pause, and reset functionality.
- **To-Do List** – Add, delete, and move tasks up or down.
- Clean and responsive layout using plain CSS.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (with Hooks)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (for development and build)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (Flexbox-based layout)

## 📦 Getting Started

> **Note:** This project uses **Vite** as the build tool instead of Create React App.

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/judefernz12/my-react-app.git
cd my-react-app
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server (via Vite):
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:5173 (or whatever Vite logs in your terminal)

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- Using `useState` to manage time and task data
- Using `useEffect` for real-time updates and cleanup
- Managing dynamic lists in React
- Structuring multiple components in a single-page app
